### How to setup?
 - For adding enchants that are not registered by PocketMine-MP you may use **[VanillaEnchantments](https://github.com/TheAz928/VanillaEnchantments)** by [@TheAz928](https://github.com/TheAz928) or **[TeaSpoon](https://github.com/CortexPE/TeaSpoon)** by [@CortexPE](https://github.com/CortexPE) for adding enchants on the items.
 - Additionally you can also add **CustomEnchants** to the items. For this you require **[PiggyCustomEnchants](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants)** by [@DaPigGuy](https://github.com/DaPigGuy).
 - Get the [.phar](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/JackMD/MysteryCrate/MysteryCrate) and drop the into your `plugins` folder.
 - Next navigate to the `crates.yml` file and edit/set the block you want the crate to be recognized with under `block: "ID:META"` key.
 - **Make sure that name of the world where crate is located is same as the world folder name.**
 - Now mention the `name` of the`world` where the crate is located in `crateWorld`.
 - Reload the server.
 - Place the block down you initially set in `crates.yml` under `block: "ID:META"` key.
 - Place either a chest, ender chest or trapped chest on top of that block.
 - To open the crate you require a `crateKey`.
 - To get the key use `/key [type] [player] [amount]` in-game and then tap the crate with it. You can set/see the crate type in `crates.yml` file.
### FAQs
**Q: How to setup the crates?**<br />
A: Please read [this](https://github.com/JackMD/MysteryCrate#how-to-setup).<br /><br />
**Q: How to add particles?**<br />

**Q: Can I edit the floating text that appears above the crate?**<br />
